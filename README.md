Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub)!

This is the lorch.social mod, maintained by an volunteer in the city Lorch fur refugees.   

It offers an real full text search (with elastic search), very basic offer/search-system for goods, and an more exchange focused interface.   

Because you may be looking for it, like I did, and I did not find any documentation on it:   
To activate a real full text search, simple edit this line:

```
definition = parsed_query.apply(StatusesIndex.filter(term: { searchable_by: @account.id }))
```
to this   
```
definition = parsed_query.apply(StatusesIndex)
```
